- Since the late 19th century, socio-economic rights which are also called â€˜second-generation rightsâ€™ started taking place in the constitutions of different countries worldwide. After World War II, international law started recognizing these rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) were adopted in 1948 because a plenty number of scholars and reformers believed that civil and political rights could hardly reach their goal without providing socio-economic rights. Socio-economic rights are indispensable for a human being to live with dignity. Incorporation in the constitution of all sets of human rights, especially Civil and Political Rights on the one hand and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the other hand evidences the stateâ€™s concern for not only protecting its individuals from state absolutism but also creating conditions that will allow every individual to develop his maximum potentials.[1] Thus, the framers of the Bangladesh Constitution stated in the Preamble of the Constitution that Bangladesh will secure the economic and social rights for all the citizens.
